# hello-world
Just another repository (demo repository for GitHub learning) 

greetings = 'hello-world'
print(f"I say, \"{greetings.upper()}\".")

Hi, humans:
This is my first time to write about myself in an online code editor.
These lines of words are committed to this editor for demonstrating how 'commits' or 'commit message' works in GitHub.com
I'm still tring to master Github. For me, it's quite challenging.
